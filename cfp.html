      <h3>General Information</h3>
      <p>The Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS) conference is an annual international conference covering
        research in theory and applications of information security. ACNS aims to attract high-quality papers in all
        technical aspects of information security. This includes submissions from academia, industry, and government on
        traditional as well as emerging topics and new paradigms in these areas, with a clear connection to real-world
        problems, systems, or applications.</p>

      <p>
        ACNS gives the best student paper award, with a 1500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer, to encourage promising
        students to publish their best results at this venue. Any paper with a student as an author is eligible for this
        award. In addition, ACNS gives the best workshop paper award, with a 500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer.
      </p>


      <h3>Instructions for Authors</h3>

      <p>ACNS 2026 will be an in-person conference. However, we want to assure everyone that we will provide 
        the option to present remotely in case there are visa issues.</p>

      <p>Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or
        accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with
        published proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for
        that purpose.</p>


      <h3>Systematization of Knowledge</h3>
      <p>ACNS 2026 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable
        to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.</p>

      <p>
        It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey), but
        also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and
        offer
        insights or new perspectives on a given major research area.
        We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the <strong>SoK:</strong> prefix to the title.
        SoK
        submissions
        will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be
        accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research
        results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and included in the proceedings.
      </p>

      <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

      <p>Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Each
        submission must begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize
        the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.</p>

      <!--
        <p>Each submission must be thoroughly anonymized, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious
        references. Submissions must not duplicate work that was published elsewhere, or work that has been submitted in
        parallel to any other conference, journal, or workshop that has proceedings. At least one author of each accepted
        paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in
        the proceedings.
      </p>
      -->

      <p>All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format (accessible on the
        <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">Springer LCNS
          author guidelines </a>webpage) and typeset using the corresponding <a
          href="https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v8">LaTeX class
          file</a> (<a
          href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WuA4JS5uZpi">Overleaf
          template</a>). They must fit within a page
        limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references. Optionally, any amount
        of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper; however,
        reviewers
        are not required to read or review any supplementary material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible
        without it. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. To
        accommodate for changes requested in reviews, the page limit for the camera-ready proceedings versions is 30
        pages, including references and appendices.
      </p>

      <p>For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures
        (such as Institutional Review Board approval) have been followed and due diligence has been made to minimize
        potential harm.</p>

      <p>ACNS 2026 has two submission deadlines (in September and January) that authors may choose to submit their
        papers to. Papers rejected after the September round cannot be resubmitted at the January round.</p>

      <p>We will publish our proceedings with Springer as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
        series.</p>


      <h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
      <p>

        The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions
        from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask
        authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest.
      </p>
      <p>We regard the following relationships as conflicts of interest:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission (including
          secondary affiliations and consulting work),</li>
        <li>Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past,</li>
        <li>Anyone the author has collaborated with or published with within the prior two years,</li>
        <li>Anyone who is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds your research, or</li>
        <li>Close personal or family ties.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If authors want to specify a conflict of another type than those listed above, they must contact the chairs and
        explain the perceived conflict. Program committee members who are in a conflict of interest with a paper,
        including program co-chairs, will be excluded from the evaluation and discussion of the paper by default.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure (adapted from IEEE S&P)</h3>

      <p>
        Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses
        in
        a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a
        way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In
        nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will
        help
        protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days to 90 days ahead of publication
        is
        consistent with the authors’ ethical obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should
        only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence 
        the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The
        authors
        are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.
        The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to
        take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to
        disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this
        policy applies to their submissions.
      </p>
