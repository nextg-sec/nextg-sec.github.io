      <h2>Call for Papers</h2>

      <h3>Workshop Overview</h3>
      <p>The workshop on <strong>NextG Networks Cryptography and Security (NextG-Sec)</strong> invites high-quality papers addressing the urgent need for securing next-generation networks and the underlying cryptographic protocols and schemes. This workshop aims to unite researchers, industry professionals, and government representatives to tackle emerging security and privacy issues in networks including 5G, 6G, and beyond.</p>

      <p>One of the key highlights is securing networks from the rising threat of quantum computing and developing <strong>Post-Quantum (PQ)-secure schemes, protocols, and solutions</strong> for NextG networks.</p>

      <h3>Topics of Interest</h3>
      <p>Papers on all technical aspects of NextG networks security and cryptography are solicited. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Development of novel NextG cryptographic protocols for various use-cases</li>
        <li>Agentic-AI based security for NextG</li>
        <li>5G and beyond network architectures (e.g., Open RAN) security</li>
        <li>Infrastructure security for 5G and beyond</li>
        <li>Network protocols for 5G and NextG</li>
        <li>AI/ML/LLM for NextG</li>
        <li>Exploitation of NextG cryptography, systems, and networks</li>
        <li>Formal analysis for NextG</li>
        <li>User privacy and data protection for 5G and NextG</li>
        <li>Intrusion detection for NextG</li>
        <li>Open challenges and research directions in NextG</li>
        <li>Secure and resilient beamforming and MIMO</li>
        <li>Testbeds and experimental frameworks for evaluating NextG security</li>
        <li>Trustworthy AI/ML in NextG</li>
        <li>Post-quantum cryptography for NextG networks</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Important Dates</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paper submission deadline:</strong> March 2026 AoE</li>
        <li><strong>Author notification:</strong> April 2026 AoE</li>
        <li><strong>Camera-ready deadline:</strong> May 2026 AoE</li>
        <li><strong>Workshop date:</strong> June 23-26, 2026</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Types of Submissions</h3>

      <h4>Full Papers</h4>
      <p>Full papers must follow the LNCS format with a page limit of 18 pages, excluding references and possible appendices, and a total page limit of 24 pages (including references and appendices).</p>

      <h4>Short Papers</h4>
      <p>Short papers describing ongoing work and bringing new insights related to NextG security. Short papers follow the same LNCS format but with a page limit of 9 pages (including references).</p>

      <h4>Talk Proposals</h4>
      <p>Proposals for talks should present key themes for reviewers to assess potential impact and quality. They are not required to be full-length research papers and must be non-anonymous. Talk proposals should be marked as such by having their title begin with "Talk Proposal:". Talks will be judged competitively with paper submissions.</p>

      <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

      <p><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Submitted papers must be anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. We follow a double-blinded review process.</p>

      <p><strong>Format:</strong> All submissions must be in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format. Use the official 
        <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS author guidelines</a> and 
        <a href="https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v8">LaTeX class file</a> 
        (<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj">Overleaf template</a>).</p>

      <p><strong>Originality:</strong> Papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for duplicate submission checks.</p>

      <p><strong>Registration:</strong> Every accepted paper must have at least one author registered for the workshop.</p>

      <p><strong>Supplementary Material:</strong> Optional supplementary material may be supplied following the main paper body, but reviewers are not required to review it.</p>

      <p><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> For papers raising ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures have been followed and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm.</p>

      <h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
      <p>Authors must identify program committee members with whom they share a conflict of interest. We regard the following as conflicts of interest:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sharing an institutional affiliation with a PC member at the time of submission</li>
        <li>Being an advisor or advisee of a PC member at any time in the past</li>
        <li>Collaborating with or publishing with a PC member within the prior two years</li>
        <li>Serving as a sponsor or administrator of a grant funding your research</li>
        <li>Close personal or family ties</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Proceedings</h3>
      <p>Accepted papers will be published in Springer's LNCS series as workshop post-proceedings.</p>

      <h3>Submission Portal</h3>
      <p>Submission details and portal link will be announced soon.</p>
