      <h2>Call for Workshop Proposals</h2>
      Proposals are solicited for workshops to be held in conjunction with ACNS 2026. Each ACNS workshop provides a
      forum to address a specific topic at the forefront of cryptography, privacy, and cybersecurity research. It can be
      either one full day or half day in length. All workshops must be held physically during the conference and
      presentations are expected to be delivered in person. At least one of the authors of each accepted workshop paper
      and at least one workshop PC chair would be expected to register at an author rate for the main conference.

      Each accepted workshop will receive one complementary registration. All workshops are expected to have a
      competitive Call for Papers and organize their own selection process, i.e., no workshops consisting of invited
      talks only will be accepted. Post-proceedings of all workshops will be published in Springer’s LNCS series.

      <!--
An ACNS workshop best paper award will be selected from the accepted papers of all workshops. Submissions of workshop proposals must reach the Workshop Chair by October 21, 2024, AoE.
-->

      Information on past ACNS workshops is available at <a
